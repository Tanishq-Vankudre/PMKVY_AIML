Model Information:

Dep. Variable: The dependent variable used in the model.
Model: The type of regression model used, which is OLS in this case.
Method: The method used to fit the model, which is least squares.
Date: The date when the model was fitted.
Time: The time when the model was fitted.
Model Fit Statistics:

R-squared: The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). Ranges from 0 to 1.
Adj. R-squared: The R-squared value adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. It penalizes the addition of irrelevant predictors.
F-statistic: A measure to test the overall significance of the model. It tests whether at least one predictor variable has a non-zero coefficient.
Prob (F-statistic): The p-value associated with the F-statistic. A low p-value (< 0.05) indicates that the model is statistically significant.
Coefficients Table:

coef: The estimated coefficients for each predictor, including the constant term.
std err: The standard error of the estimated coefficients.
t: The t-statistic for each coefficient.
P>|t|: The p-value for the t-statistic. A low p-value (< 0.05) indicates that the coefficient is significantly different from zero.
[0.025, 0.975]: The 95% confidence interval for the coefficient estimates.
Diagnostic Measures:

Durbin-Watson: A test statistic to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals.
Omnibus: A test statistic for the joint hypothesis that the skewness and kurtosis of the residuals are zero.
Prob(Omnibus): The p-value associated with the Omnibus test.
Jarque-Bera (JB): A test statistic for testing whether the residuals are normally distributed.
Prob(JB): The p-value associated with the Jarque-Bera test.
Skew: The skewness of the residuals.
Kurtosis: The kurtosis of the residuals.
Cond. No: The condition number, a measure of multicollinearity. A high condition number suggests multicollinearity problems.
